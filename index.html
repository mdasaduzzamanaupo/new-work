 theseyoung men come forwardwith their stories ofinequalityand mistreatment
 based on there skin color.
The one consistent theme i have heard and read amongst their outcries was lack of 
support, space to be heard, and action taken when they have voiced it . i see a lot 
of people saying why now , what changed why are you just saying something ? The 
reality is a lot these caaches hold keys to these athletes future , their education , 
and fore some the path to the next level of football (NFL). That’s a lot of power 
when in the wrong hands . As a result these guy stay silent , they conform and do 
what is needed to reach their goal. we see it everyday when a player voices their 
stance they are told to shut up and dribble, or i saw a fan tell one kid as a free 
educatuion is not enough? The fan then proceeded to tell the kid to be gratful and 
shut up and play !(Yikes) I digress. The reality is their is nothing free about the 
education given. Colleges and Universities make millions on the books of these 
athletes, and they work harder than the average student. sometimes my kid has 
12 hour days because aside from team meetings, weightlifting,practice and playing 
in games they have the same expactations to perform academicaly 

I want say to the guys both past and present that we hear you ,but i also hear the cries
of these all over the world . However, we are in a space and time where listening 
without putting forward action is no longer acceptable . 

so i have decided to start a not for profit organization called “The Minority Athlete 
Coalition ”.One og the biggest goals will be to educate collegiate programs on racial 
sensitivity, and to help them develop an inclusive  culture where all genders , and 
races are treated well, and experience the same equality as their counterparts. This 
will also serve  inequality in their prospective program. This is my thought on paper
but, I will be partnering with collegiate programs, athletes both amateur and professional 
so that we can eradicate this problem together ! Stay Tuned #bethechange #Blackboymom

“We get better as a people when truth is spoken, listening begins, and action is taken ” -
